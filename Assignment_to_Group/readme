ASSIGN_Pcinna.py => report probability of assignement of unknown P. cinnamomi individual (sequenced with ON reads) 
to each of the five genetic group defined in Shakya et al. (2021). Probabilities are estimated using a linearSVC model
trained with SNPs of All_SNPs.xls. SNPs in the unknown P. cinnamomi individual are identified by mapping ON reads to the 
P. cinnamomi reference genome Phyci1_AssemblyScaffolds.fasta.

Requirement:  SAMTOOLS & BWA

Test_LinearSVMpredictor.py =>  returns the performance of linear SVC model with different number of SNPs for predicting correct genetic group in 
P. cinnamomi [using SNP set published in Shakya et al. (2021; Mol Ecol. 30: 5164-5178.)].
